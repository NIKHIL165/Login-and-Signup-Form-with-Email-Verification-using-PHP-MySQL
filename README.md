 # Don't forget to follow  the account for more projects like this.
At first, on the webpage, there is shown only a login form and inside the login form, there is a signup now link to redirect the user to the first signup before login. When the user tries to log in without even signup the form, there is displayed an error message labeled as “It looks like you’re not yet a member! Click on the bottom link to signup”.

In the signup form, while the user is signing up, if he enters the same email, which already exists in our database then there is displayed an error message labeled as “Email that you’ve entered is already exist!”. And when the user doesn’t match two password combinations, there is also displayed an error message labeled as “Your confirm password not matched”.
